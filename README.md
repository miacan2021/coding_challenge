# OctoAI Interview Challenge
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

To start the challenge, clone this repo and run `yarn install` and `yarn dev` in the root directory.
Find the instructions inside `src/App.tsx` and `src/Users.tsx`.

```bash
yarn install

yarn dev
```
